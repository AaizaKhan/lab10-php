Part B: 
Arrays
:
 
 
 
An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type of values in a 
single value.
 
Three types of arrays
 
are
 
supported by PHP:
 
1.
 
Numeric array
-
An array with a numeric index. Values are stored 
and 
accessed in linear fashion
 
2.
 
Associative array
-
An array with strings as index
 
(keys)
. This stores element 
values in association with key values rather than in a strict linear index order.
 
3.
 
Multidimensional array
-
An array containing one or more array
s and values 
are accessed using multiple indices
 
i.e. array of arrays.
 
 
The foreach loop is usually used to loop through the arrays.
 
Exa
mples of arrays 
are shown below. All three types of arrays are created using the built
-
in 
array() 
 
constructor in PHP.
